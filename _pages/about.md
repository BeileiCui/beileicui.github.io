I am currently a Ph.D student at [Medical Mechatronics Lab](http://www.labren.org/mm/) of the [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), supervised by [Prof.Hongliang Ren](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree in 2021 in [School of Information and Communication Engineering](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof.Zhizhong Fu](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/info/1450/11711.htm). I also studied at [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) in [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and received my M.Sc degree in 2022 advised by [Dr.Javier Barria](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.barria).

My research interests include artificial intelligent applications in medical image analysis, robotic perception and robotic navigation. I am recently working on self-supervised monocular depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, NeRF, noisy label learning.

I am always passionate about discussion or potential cooperation opportunities so feel free to contact me via email if have related inquiries! [Medical Mechatronics Lab](http://www.labren.org/mm/) is also open for __research interns__, don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested. Specifically, [Student helper programme](https://www.osa.cuhk.edu.hk/flourishingcuhk/student-helper-engagement-scheme/for-students/) are available for CUHK undergraduate & MSc students.
